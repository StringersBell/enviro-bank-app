# enviro-bank-app

A simple bank application that implements functionality of depositing money into an account and withdrawing money from an account. This application comes from a take home assessment that was given to a friend who applied for a junior java software developer position.

The bank runs only two types of accounts, namely, a savings account, and a current account.

1. Savings Account:

- Should have an opening balance of R1000

2. Current Account

- Has a maximum opening overdraft of 100000
- One cannot withdraw more than the balance + overdraft
